<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reinforcement-learning-in-the-real-world">Reinforcement learning in the real world</h3>
<p>The presenter covers the analysis of different Q-learning approaches in the context of their presentation.</p>
<p>They also cover the importance of evaluating a learned policy and how that can be done.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to understand how well out optimcal policy is able to learn an optimal set of decisions</li>
<li>We need to propose a set of actions that is realistic for the organization to implement</li>
<li>We need to interpret out how our optimcal policy differs from the data generating behavior policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions that we need to ask, outlined above, help us to evaluate the effectiveness of our approaches in the real world.</p>
<section id="online-and-offline-policy-evaluation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="online-and-offline-policy-evaluation">Online and offline policy evaluation</h4>
<p>Defn : Evaluating a learned policy through the simulation of the environment</p>
<p>Considerations :</p>
<section id="online-evaluation" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="online-evaluation">Online Evaluation</h5>
<ul>
<li>Are we even able to simluate the dynamics of the environment?</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="offline-evaluation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="offline-evaluation">Offline Evaluation</h4>
<ul>
<li>More easily applied to historical data (we don’t have access to a simluation environment)</li>
<li>Important sampling can be used to estimate the expected reward under a new policy</li>
<li>Requires estimates of the behavior policy which is usually estimated by separate supervised models</li>
</ul>
<p>This might be the only way forward as we don’t have the capability to simulate the dynamics of the envoironment.</p>
</section>
<section id="importance-sampling-for-offline-policy-evaluation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="importance-sampling-for-offline-policy-evaluation">Importance Sampling for offline policy evaluation</h4>
<p>Goal of PS : estimate the value of a new policy</p>
<p>Take the ratio of the optimal bahavoior policy at a given time point and * reward at the time step / number of data points – this generates an estimator for the expected value of importance sampling</p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pros-and-cons">Pros and Cons</h5>
<ul>

<li>In this case we choose a multivariate Gaussian <a href="">Slide</a><a href="">Paper</a></li>
<li>We can express in terms of gradient of Hessian of the loss
<ul>
<li>We can use this expectation parameter and ask questions about higher order information about the loss surface</li>

<ul>
<li>If we add momentum to the bayesian objective a lot of these things can be explained using similar prinsiples</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bayes as optimization <a href="">Slide</a> <a href="">Papers</a>
<ul>
<li>What we can do to derive the bayes rule in this special case
<ul>
<li>We define the loss to be the negative log joint (estimate)</li>
<li>We can plug this into an objective function over all distributions</li>
<li>With no restriction we should arrive at the posterior distribution</li>
<li>Entropy is the negative expected value</li>
<li>The expectation of the log ratio of q over e^-l becomes 0 (as log(1) = 0)</li>

<li>Bayes with Approximate Posterior

<li>Trying to make a point that using this learning rule, how do we optimize it?

<li>Computing these messages in forward backward algorithm, we’re finding the expectation of the gradient</li>
<li>We can write this loss as two parts

<li>loss of the joint</li>
<li>depends on the data (conjugate really means depends on the data)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Choose a q to match the sufficient statistics</li>
<li>We can write this as a combination of a learning term and a quadratic term</li>
<li>Compute the expectation fo the loss, we can see that it’s linear in the expectation parameter</li>
<li>The expectation of the loss is linear in the expectation parameter

<ul>
<li>One line of work proved popular and just keep running standard DL, and then use some ideas to dropout some weights, and doing this it somehow corresponds to solving this bayesian problem (see paper)
<ul>
<li>Pros : Scales well to large problems</li>
<li>Cons : Not flexible</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Point is to get the average with the goal of “how do we choose this average”
<ul>
<li>Get this model, and perturb and this allows to add some noise and allow us to explore a bit</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The principle of SGD corresponds to a Gaussian with parameters that we cannot really control</li>

<li>Remove the “local” approximation of the Expectation</li>
<li>Add some second order approximation</li>
<li>No square root of the scale</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Takes some more computation but it’s worth it in that we’re estimation varaince of the diagonal gaussian then we might want to make that tradeoff</li>
<li>Estimating a diagonal gaussian with some variance around it, and the variance scaled</li>
<li>We can borrow a lot of tricks from the DL side of the world through the framing of the problem we covered previously</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>BDL Methods do not really know that they are performing badly under dataset shift</p>
<ul>
<li>This is telling us about uncertainty and about performance
<ul>
<li>We are shifting the data slowly and we can see that accuracy goes down</li>

<li><p>Challenges in Uncertainty Estimation</p>
<ul>
<li>We can’t just take bayesian principles and apply them to non-convex problems</li>
<li>different local minima correcpond to various solutions
<ul>
<li>local approximations only capture “local uncertainty” – in the same way that DL only captures a local solution to the functional defn</li>
<li>These methods miss a whole lot of the data space</li>
<li>This is a very hard problem</li>
</ul></li>
<li>More flexible approximations really tells us that we need to go beyond second order optimization

<li>Partition the dataset into space of disjoint cells such that similar individuals are in the same cell.</li>
<li>Individuals in the same cell should be treated similarly</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Lipschitz continuity implies individual fairness</p>
<ul>
<li>Good news : One can achieve fairness through Lipshitz regularization.</li>
<li>Bad news : Data is non-Euclidean (eg. images, graphs, etc).
<ul>
<li>Standard Euclidean distance metrics aren’t a good measure for this</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Challenge : Can we learn representations of the data such that the l_2 norm is a good metric to compare instances?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Group Fairness : Similar Classifier Statistics across groups <a href="">Slides</a></p></li>
<li><p>(im-)possibility result for group-fair classification</p>
<ul>
<li>Classifier statistics are not artbitrarily flexible</li>
<li>eg. Binary classification statistics have two degrees of freesom thus can match two independent statistics across groups</li>
<li>Beyond binary classification, the degrees of freedom grows quadratically with number of classes</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Group Fairness : Advantages and Challenges</p>
<ul>
<li>Advantages
<ul>
<li>Fairly easy to compute and roughly scales with the number of samples</li>
<li>Often easier to explain to policy-makeers (as in terms of population behavior)</li>
<li>More existing work, strategies already exist for representation learning Challenges:</li>
<li>data regulator must determine which classifier statistics to equalize.</li>
<li>fairness of the representation depends on the quality of the fairness metric chosen by the regulator</li>
<li>Group fairness can lead to (more) violated individual fairness, e.g intersectionality can lead to fairness gerrymandering</li>

<ul>
<li>How can two people living in the same world come to two different conclusions?</li>
<li>5 Things Everyone in ML Should know about
<ol type="1">
<li>Humans continuously form beliefs
<ul>
<li>We don’t set them and we’re done</li>
<li>We continuously update our beliefs</li>
<li>Every time we encounter an instance of a bowl, we update our beliefs about bowls</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Certainty diminishes interest
<ul>
<li>What you think you know is what determines your curiosity</li>
<li>People do not have an accurate model of their own uncertainty</li>
<li>If you think you know the answer, you won’t check, and if we present the right answer to the person they <em>still</em> reject it
<ul>
<li>Might be why there is confirmation bias</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Certainty is feedback driven
<ul>
<li>high level beliefs about concepts
<ul>
<li>most useful for the decision making points in our lives
<ul>
<li>we are sometimes certain when we shouldn’t be</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>People learned a novel rule based concept
<ul>
<li>boolean logic to determine daxxy-ness</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the beginning there is no concept, it could be a property of the system, or not</li>
<li>Entropy of an idealized model has little to do with interest and learning
<ul>
<li>instead this certainty comes from feedback</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reasoning about the world
<ul>
<li>Flat earthers – if they watch online videos that confirm this it might increase the chance of early adoption of this idea as truth</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Less feedback may encourage overconfidence</li>
<li>Humans form beliefs quickly
<ul>
<li>Early evidence counts more than later evidence
<ul>
<li>Leads to becoming certain and plays down our ability to update our beliefs</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>There is no such thing as a neutral tech platform
<ul>
<li>The order in which information is presented makes a huge difference in our understanding of the world</li>
<li>This reinforces some of the studies done around the 2016 elections</li>
<li>Children are consuming more online data and this is affecting them</li>

<li>generalization bounds and robust classification lean on this</li>
<li>This problem of computing Lipschitz constants is NP hard so we try to find tight bounds around this</li>
<li>Say we have an accurate upper bound of a model
<ul>
<li>We can take a point f(x), and we can measure of mis-classification and input that back into the network
<ul>
<li>We can certify that if we perturb X in a small ball drawn around this delta, it odesn’t change the classification</li>
<li>If we can find this small lipschitz constanc we might be able to prove that this network has a form of robustness</li>

<li>Address something asked by DaVinci - How are we made?
<ul>
<li>We’re created from a single cell and it eentually creates every cell in our body.</li>
<li>How does this process happen?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cells are like tiny computers, taking input and output through things like proliferation, differentiation, and activation</li>
<li>ALl cells have the same genetic code – 3 billion letters
<ul>
<li>How our genome is the instruction set for assembling the different cells</li>
<li>Telling eachother how to behave</li>
<li>We have 100’s of cells</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Single cell RNA-sequencing in droplet micro-fluids

<li>Measures for every single gene and cell for what gene it is and what cell it came from</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The data matric for one sample ~ 250 million
<ul>
<li>Gene by cell matrix that is rife with errors and artifacts from measurement</li>
<li>We only capture about 5% of the transcripts, or what the humans are expressing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the field, zero-inflation has taken root
<ul>
<li>It’s wrong</li>
<li>“Drop out” – this is uniform sampling and it sometimes leaves us to capture no gene or transcription gene
<ul>
<li>every sample is affected by this</li>
<li>No value is at it’s actual value</li>
<li>This should be modeled properly and not with 0 inflation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do we handle all of this data
<ul>
<li>We like to visualize into 2 and 3 dimensions</li>
<li>PCA failed this data type and we couldn’t visualize it very well</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Following a Keynote at NeurIPS, someone presented T-SNE and it seems to fit the data well and we get good cell level separation</li>
<li>While we might have a matrix of 20000 genes x 100000 cells – T-SNE and UMAP seem to capture this non-linearity well</li>
<li>We have this manifold because cell phenotypes are highly regulated
<ul>
<li>We can see in 3D the nicely shaped non-convex shape</li>
<li>Similar shapes in families because few regulators drive cell shape</li>
<li>Lots of feedback loops and interactions between these genes, which limits and constricts the phenotypes a cell can be in</li>
<li>Still have challenges in visualization
<ul>
<li>Build better vis for this data as it’s non-uniform and 5 orders of different density
<ul>
<li>Challenge is to handle this data with such different densities, it trips up many of the approaches we have today</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Common way to viz beyond 2 or 3 dimensions using nearest neighbor graphs
<ul>
<li>We connect a cell to cells nearest that cell
<ul>
<li>This is dependent on probability distributions which help to define this similarity metric</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The idea is one we have this graph we can really retain the manifold and use things like geodesic differences
<ul>
<li>Each tiny differnce in this graph can represent small differences between cells
<ul>
<li>We can do distances and walks in these grpahs that allow us to measure the distance between cells</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Data is extreme structures and there are communities
<ul>
<li>Social media community detection approaches find cell states and cell densities that are captures as cliques in the graph</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Nice thing is that these graphs are connected
<ul>
<li>They share connectivity which allows us to cpature cell type transitions
<ul>
<li>These transitions are very sparse relative to the cell type</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Using 100 ro 200 examples over 10000 entities
<ul>
<li>This isn’t regular science and this works because biology has lots of structure and isn’t adversarial in that respect</li>
<li>100000 or 1000000 cellshave awesome things – treating each cell as a computer we can assume that the mollecrular influences create statistical dependencies in the data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Out of the box algorithm gets us a correct reconstruction with no prior information of TCell networks</li>
<li>Thisallows us to do disease regulatory networks and helps us to understand what is wrong in this specific cancer patient</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Asynchronous nature of the data
<ul>
<li>All of our immune cells are in our bone marrow and these cells are able to generate all varities of immune cells within our bodies</li>
<li>Asynchrony enables the inference of temporal pgoression</li>
<li>From a single time point we can capture all of the dynamics of the process</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pesudo-time
<ul>
<li>Reconstructing developement which allows us to reconstruct order grom a single time point</li>
<li>THis process is highly non-linear we can order cells by chronology and the assumption is cell phenotypes change gradually ` * Cannot be treated as absolute values as we know this data is incredinly noisey</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wanderlust
<ul>
<li>We are able to reconstruct accurate progressions and discover order and timing of key events along differentiation</li>
<li>This checkpoint of DNS recombinations inside of a cell, we wanted to understand if it were OK
<ul>
<li>pediatric cancer is caused by understanding this checkpoint</li>
<li>This wasn’t known until we could find this tiny new cell population and it’s novel regulation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Data is structured
<ul>
<li>bifurcations through use of walks and waypooints
<ul>
<li>the direct route between two cells along the same path should be more direct than non-immediate connections</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These waypoints help to resolve structure
<ul>
<li>We find these using spectral clustering</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mapping development
<ul>
<li>We want to order these cells on their manifold and understand how they bifurcate</li>
<li>What decision making is going on and what is their possible future cell types and propensity to turn into these cell types</li>
<li>Palantir : Building a Markiv Chain out of this graph allows us to find time ordering in our neighbor grpahs
<ul>
<li>strong assumption that development goes forward and not back</li>
<li>broken in processes such as cancer
<ul>
<li>build a directed graph from this</li>
</ul></li>
<li>we can look at the extrema states and we find ourselves with an absorbing markov chain</li>
<li>This allows us to compute the end states of all of our cells and we can roll out the fate for each cell
<ul>
<li>entropy of these probabiities for all cells</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The proof is in the pudding – applied to early mouse developemnt (endoderm (all internal organs are made of this))</li>
<li>Data organized nicely along these dimensions
<ul>
<li>cells aligned along temporal orders</li>
<li>approximal distral organizations</li>
<li>These organizations happen head to tail</li>
<li>A smooth gut tube, even though we can’t see anything that accounts for this organization, we can see the primodal organs jutting out from this tube</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can transcriptionally see where cells are headed a full day before they progress in that way
<ul>
<li>We go into the early days of the first decisions of the cells
<ul>
<li>cell can become one of many classes</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can take spatio-temporal maps of the mamaallian endoderm
<ul>
<li>We see when FGR1 and FGR2 are both high, they’ll be primitive endoderm</li>

<li>Behavioral cloning</li>
<li>Supervised learning through observations of experts</li>
<li>Not perfect

<li>Expert state and we roll out these states we get errors of the imitator acculator that show up in other parts of the state space</li>
<li>distributional shift that arises due to this causality</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Does more information lead to better performance?
<ul>
<li>What happens under distribution shift?</li>
<li>Turns out that a given model learns to pay attention to the road and brakes when someone is in the road</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These fail because the model cannot infer causality</li>
<li>Can we predict the expert’s next action
<ul>
<li>This is the only cause</li>
<li>The expert ignore it and its nuisance variable</li>
<li>End state variables
<ul>
<li>If we learn 1 imitator that watches the road</li>
<li>We can learn another imitator that wrongly treats both variables as a cause</li>
</ul></li>
<li>IN general if we have 2^N possible causal graphs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Existence of causal confusion
<ul>
<li>Consider 2 examples
<ul>
<li>learns actions through history and one that doesn’t</li>
<li>validation score on held out data history plays a role in working well with history but in test it causes confusion</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do we demonstrate this
<ul>
<li>We add to the original state and use this information to create confounded states</li>
<li>This corresponds to having just the causal</li>
<li>Use a VAE and treat the dimensions of the latent variables as potential causes
<ul>
<li>Using behavioral cloning on the original state we get expert like rewards</li>
<li>On confouded states, we do much worse indicating causal confusion</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What we need is to have a causal graph that indicates the random variables that the expertt pays attention to</li>
<li>In the first phease we learn from all possible causal graphs
<ul>
<li>Binary vectors 1 - cause, 2 - nuisance</li>
<li>randomly sample a causal graph and mask out the nuisance part of the state</li>
<li>we concatenate the graph and feed it to into a NN and it predicts an action
<ul>
<li>behavioral cloning loss</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the second phase we infer the correct causal graph
<ul>
<li>intervention changes th distribution of the state</li>
<li>we score all possible graphs on additional information

<li>Mode 1 : query reward</li>

<li>we’re beginning to understand that ML architectures seem to have innateness</li>

<li>How far can we push this innateness idea
<ul>
<li>To what extent can NN architectures along encode solutions to tasks?</li>
<li>Different kind of NAS
<ul>
<li>WE’re looking for NAS’ that perform without any training at all</li>
<li>Judged on 0-shot performance</li>
<li>Because of the large weight space
<ul>
<li>Use a single value for our weight space</li>
<li>Judge how well the network works by doing several roll out with different values</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create a population of minimal networks
<ul>
<li>These have inputs with no hidden nodes, connected to some outputs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Performance of the network is averaged over rollouts and then ranked
<ul>
<li>vary the networks to create new populations and continue the process</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can vary in one of 3 ways
<ul>
<li>Inset node</li>
<li>Add hidden connection</li>
<li>Change the activation function

<li>Gauss</li>
<li>ReLU</li>

<li>when trained can reach SoTA</li>

<li>Randomize the weights they don’t perform well</li>
<li>Shared weights produce pretty good behaviors</li>
<li>If we tune the weights, they perform the same kind of SoTA performance as general purpose networks
<ul>
<li>Able to do this with much smaller networks, sometimes orders of magnitudes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For fun we tested this on MNIST

<li>Architectures we should explore to introduce the compositionality that we’ll need to explore
<ul>
<li>NN’s that operate on sets of objects, and not just vectors</li>
<li>Dynamical recombination</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Changes in distribution (from IID to OOD)
<ul>
<li>Artifically shuffle the data the achieve that?
<ul>
<li>Natures does not shuffle the data, we shouldn’t
<ul>
<li>IRM paper from Bottou</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Out of distribution generalization and transfer
<ul>
<li>No free lunch : need new assumptions to change this IID assumption</li>
<li>If we discard this IID assumption, we need to replace it by something else</li>
<li>Bengio posits priors might be the way to do this.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>OOD Generalization
<ul>
<li>The phenomenon of learner being able to genearlaize in some way to a different distribution
<ul>
<li>If we are a learning agent (agent = actions)
<ul>
<li>we almost always face non-stationarities
<ul>
<li>Due to actions of self (agent)</li>
<li>actions of other agents</li>
<li>movement through time and space</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once we start looking at multi-agent systems, it gets even more complicated</li>
<li>THERE IS NO STATIONARITY IN OUR ABILITY TO SAMPLE REALITY IN THE WAY THAT WE DO</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compositionality helps IID and OOD to generalize
<ul>
<li>Introducting more forms of compositionality allows us to learn from some finite set of combinations about a much larger set of combinations that are NOT in the set of the data that we have today</li>
<li>Distributed representations
<ul>
<li>Helps us see why we get an exponential advantage
<ul>
<li>If we make the right assumptions, these things can be explained by variables and factors, and once we train a bunch of eatures we can generalize to new combinations of these features</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each layer is composed for the next one, and this gives us another exponential advantage
<ul>
<li>The one we know best we find in language
<ul>
<li>We call this systemasticity</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>This opens the door to better powers of analogies and abstract reasoning</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Systematic generalization
<ul>
<li>Dynamically recombining existing concepts into new concepts</li>
<li>Even when new combinations have 0 probability under training distributions
<ul>
<li>eg. science fiction scenarios</li>
<li>eg. Driving in an unknown city</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Not very successful with the use of DL systems
<ul>
<li>Current methods when asking models to answer questions not in the distribution they do not know how to answer them</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Constrast with Symbolic AI Programs
<ul>
<li>Avoiding the pitfalls of classical AI rule-based symbol-manipulation</li>
<li>Need efficient large scale learning</li>
<li>need semantic grounding</li>
<li>need distributed representations for generalization</li>
<li>efficient = trained search (also system 1)</li>
<li>Need uncertainty handling</li>
<li>But want
<ul>
<li>systematic generalization</li>
<li>factorizing knowledge into small exchangable pieces</li>
<li>manipulating variables, instances, references &amp; indirection</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>System 2
<ul>
<li>Consciousness and attention
<ul>
<li>Focus on one or a few elements at a time
<ul>
<li>when translating we focus on a specific word to do the translation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Content-based soft attnetion is convenient, can backprop to <em>learn where to attend</em>
<ul>
<li>Soft-max that conditions on each of the elements and we can see how well we match on context</li>
<li>Attention is parallel in that we compute a score for each and decide which ones where we want to put attnetion</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Attention should be thought of as the internal action
<ul>
<li>needs a <strong>learned attention policy</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>SoTA language models all rely on attention
<ul>
<li>How attention, connected to memory, can also unlock the problem of vanishing gradients</li>
<li>Operating on unbounded sets of key value pairs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can think of attention as creating a dynamic connection between layers
<ul>
<li>as opposed to being hard coded today</li>
<li>This is great, but from the point of view of the receiving model, it receives a value but it has no idea of where it’s coming from
<ul>
<li>We condition to the value, we have the concept of a key, an identifier for where this value came from
<ul>
<li>We use this as a routing mechanism</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Downstream computation can know what the value it’s receiving and where it’s coming from
<ul>
<li>Creating a name for these objects through a form of indirection</li>
<li>we have systems of operating on sets</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>From <strong>attention</strong> to <strong>consciouness</strong>
<ul>
<li>C-word is a bit taboo – but maybe not anymore</li>
<li>number of theories are related to the global workspace theory
<ul>
<li>This theory says that what is going on with consciousness, there is a bottleneck of information in that some elements of what is computed in your brain is selected and then broadcast to the rest of the brain and influencing it</li>
<li>Conditions heavily on perception and action
<ul>
<li>Also gives rise naturally to the system 2 abilities above</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Relation to ML?
<ul>
<li>ML can be used to help brain scientist understand consciouness</li>
<li>Work in neuroscience is based on fairly qualitative defns
<ul>
<li>ML can help us to quantify what this actually means</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Feedback loops help provide specific tests that we can use to measure these concepts</li>
<li>One of these motivations it to get rid of fuzziness and magic that surrounds consciousness</li>
<li>Provide advantages to these particular form of agents</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Thoughts, Consciousness, Language
<ul>
<li>There is as trong ling between thoughts and language, in that one can be translated between mediums farily easily though a lot of information si dropped on the floor during decoding</li>
<li>We want to explore things like Grounded Language Learning, by learning through environment interaction and perception
<ul>
<li>Allows a learning to get to patterns through to it’s understanding of how the world works</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The consciousness prior : sparse factor graphs
<ul>
<li>We can use these systems to encourage our learning systems to do a good job at out of distribution reasoning</li>
<li>Sparse factor graph
<ul>
<li>attention : to form conscious state, thought</li>
<li>A thought is low dimensional object
<ul>
<li>We sample these from a larger higher dimensional conscious state</li>
<li>The conscious states that we sample</li>
<li>The thoughts we consciously have are pushed through this consciousness bottleneck</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>What do these computations mean
<ul>
<li>Some kind of inference is required</li>
<li>What kind of joint distribution of high level concepts are we reasoning about</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Think about the kind of statements we make with natural language
<ul>
<li>“If I drop the ball, it will fall on the ground”
<ul>
<li>true but involved very few variables in that the statement only contains a finite number of words</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The relationship that I need to descibe can tightly capture the elements of this joint probability through very few variables</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Disentangled factors != marginally independent, eg. hand &amp; ball
<ul>
<li>We think of these as having this very structured joint distribution</li>
<li>They come with very strong and powerful relationships</li>
<li>Instead of imposing a very strong prior of complete margin independence we can find some prior that finds a joint distribution between these high level variables</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Meta-Learning : End to end
<ul>
<li>Meta-learning is learning to learn
<ul>
<li>Backprop through inner loop</li>
<li>Having multiple timescales of learning
<ul>
<li>iterative optimization like computation</li>
<li>out of loop evolution</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In this way we can talk about evolution algorithms, etc. and when we talk about this in the life of an individual
<ul>
<li>lifetime learning is the outer loop and local interaction through time is the inner loop</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can train it’s slow timescale meta parameters to generalize to new environments</li>
<li>What kind of hypothesis can we make?
<ul>
<li>becaue these actions are localized in space and time, because these things are locallly temporal then we can try to understand</li>
<li>Independent of cause and mechainsim – from an information perspective
<ul>
<li>learning from one mechanism tells you nothing of the others</li>
<li>if something like this changes due to an intervention then ew only need to adapt the portion of the model that has to deal with that part of the distribution</li>
<li>It can be explained by a tiny change</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Good representations of variables and mechanisms + localized change hypothesis
<ul>
<li>few bits needed to adapt to what has happened</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>How to factorize a joint distribution in this way?
<ul>
<li>Learning whether A causes B
<ul>
<li>Learner doesn’t know but we might observe just X and Y</li>
<li>Turns out, if we have the right composition then we can use this to learn about how to map X to Y, such as things like pixels that don’t have causal structure in that image itself</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The assumption that these high level variables are causal doesn’t work on pixels
<ul>
<li>We cna’t find a pixel that causes another pixel</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Learning neural causal models
<ul>
<li>we can avoid the exponential number of grpahs that need to be considered through this</li>
<li>ONe of the things found was that in order ot facilitate the causal structure the learner should try to infer the intervention on which variable it was performed</li>
<li>most of the time our brain is trying to figure out “What caused the changes that I am seeing?”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Able to find these commonly used causal induction methods
<ul>
<li>Attacking this problem in a deep learning friendly way
<ul>
<li>defined obejective with some regularization</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Operating on sets of objects
<ul>
<li>Using dynamically recombinations of objects</li>
<li>Recurrent Independent Mechanisms
<ul>
<li>operating on sets of these objects</li>
<li>applied to recurrentness
<ul>
<li>state is broken into pieces</li>
<li>constaining the way these networks are talking to eachother in that they done in sparse and dynamic ways</li>
<li>vectors aren’t the standard vectors but rather sets of pairs
<ul>
<li>networks are exchanging variables along with their type (key, value) pairs
<ul>
<li>leads to better out of distribution generalization than those that don’t use these structures</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tested in reinforcement learning
<ul>
<li>found it helped in atari games</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Recap
<ul>
<li>Conscious processing by agents, systematic generalization
<ul>
<li>Sparse factor graphs in space of high-level semantic variables</li>
<li>Semantic variables are causal : agents, intentios, controllable objects</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Shares “rules” or modules that are reusable across tuples
<ul>
<li>A particular subnetwork recieves input that is different dependent on context
<ul>
<li>This can be applied to different instances in that it’s much more like a bayes net but the same parameters can be used in many spaces</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>another really important hypothesis is that the changes in dsitribution are mostly localized if we’re presented information</li>
<li>Things preserved across changes in distribution have to be grounded in that they’re stable and robust to stationarity</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Brain is an organize that integrated bio-information with electricity
<ul>
<li>working on integrating across discplines to get better models of brain functions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Causality???
<ul>
<li>If we understand how the brain does what it does, we can reverse engineer it and use that to understand it better</li>
<li>Can we turn on and off other areas of the brain</li>
<li>We come to this conclusion around causality because human beings have observed the earht other and over again in many contexts and test these assumptions using models and test these assumptions and map them back to our models
<ul>
<li>This is important for neuroscience
<ul>
<li>Many of the manipulations of the brain cause it to not function how it does naturally
<ul>
<li>It might make more sense to observe the system over and over again</li>
<li>We can test these models
<ul>
<li>If that’s the case, the human body is 98 degrees farenheit</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Depression (DSM)
<ul>
<li>depressed mood</li>
<li>diminished interest</li>
<li>increase or decrease in appetite</li>
<li>hypersomnia or insomnia</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is MDD prevention a viable therapeutic strategy?
<ul>
<li>Imagine a disease case where someone has a heart attack of failure
<ul>
<li>make that heart pump more normally</li>
<li>Idea is to make a diseased heart and make it function more normally</li>
<li>One of the things that has the greatest impact on the system of the heart was aging
<ul>
<li>measured variables in lifestyle that might help predict heart attack later on in life</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Emotions at latent networks
<ul>
<li>The idea is that we use fMRI to look at changes in bloodflow in the brain
<ul>
<li>Using these changes as a proxy for brain activation</li>
<li>Taking healthy controls, or students</li>
<li>Put them in a scanner and let them watch movies while inducing emotions
<ul>
<li>Use ML to see what emotional patterns were induced</li>
</ul></li>
<li>After about 20 mins they tap the students and ask how they were feeling</li>
<li>This suggests we’re able to liberate the emotion from the patients’ brain without self-reporting</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Assumptions
<ul>
<li>Assumption 1: Emotional encoding at the second timescale
<ul>
<li>This is important because people have classically thought about controlling variables and repeatedly observe a system</li>
<li>Useful for studying vision, motor function, sensory systems, etc.
<ul>
<li>This system might be built to do something <em>very</em> different than emotional systems</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When we have a system to process emotions, we want something that has information resonance at a slower timescale than moving arms, and legs, etc.</li>
<li>Emotions are encoded at the timescale of seconds</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Assmption 2 : Emergent Properties
<ul>
<li>We have a cell property and it traverses a neuron and checmical information is sent down the axxon
<ul>
<li>hard to think about emergent properties of these systems</li>
<li>a seizure is an emergent property of the brain
<ul>
<li>wouldn’t generate this phenomenon without more than 4 cells</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The system is working together in an integration fashion to create these properties</li>
<li>THINK SLEEP</li>
<li>LOcal field potentials can be used to measure certain properties of the system</li>
<li>LFP coherence (functional connectivity)</li>
<li>sycnhrony or coherence
<ul>
<li>we can infer directionality in a circuit</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Coupling between cell firing and LFP activity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Assumption 3 : Local Field Potentials reflects the activity of populations of neurons (emergent features)
<ul>
<li>Trying to find things that generalize across brains, species, and inviduals</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Latent Network Model

<li>Limitations of Kernel Methods <a href="">Slide</a>
<ul>
<li>This property might not be a good thing</li>

<ul>
<li>There is huge interest in the intersection between Neural Networks and Bayesian Believers</li>
<li>epistemic estimation is REALLY important for areas with high risk
<ul>
<li>bayesian or not there is a really great potential to healthcare and autonomous driving</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Type of Uncertainty <a href="">Slides</a>
<ul>
<li>Epistemic uncertainty “how much do I believe this coin is fair?”
<ul>
<li>models’ belief after seeing the population</li>
<li>reduces when we have more data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Aleatoric Uncertainty - “What’s the nest coin flip outcome?”
<ul>
<li>Individual experiment outcome</li>
<li>non-reducible</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Distribution Shift - “Am I still flipping the same coin?”
<ul>
<li>Indicating a change of the underlying quantity of interesting</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Quick intro to BNN’s <a href="">Slide</a>
<ul>
<li>instead of learning point updates, let’s put a distribution in place here over the parameters</li>
<li>in practice <span class="math inline">\(p(w|D)\)</span> is intractable
<ul>
<li>Find an approximation <span class="math inline">\(q(W) \approx P(W|D)\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Weight space uncertainty is less interesting
<ul>
<li>in many cases NN’s weights are NOT scientific parameters we’re interested in</li>
<li>symmetries/invariance in parameterization
<ul>
<li>exmaples like swapping nodes and scaling of weights, we’re still approximating the same function</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>This introduces vagueness <a href="">Slide</a>
<ul>
<li>sample weights from the Q distribution</li>
<li>folklore belief for function-space (or output-space) uncertainty:</li>
<li>“Epistemic uncertainty should be high when new input is less similar to observed inputs”</li>
<li><strong>What do “high uncertainty” and “less similar” mean qualitatively?</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is typically “eye-balled”, leaving it to be subjective by definition</li>
<li>There is really no agreeable diescription of where and by how much it should be higher</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Evaluating by comparing to references <a href="">Slide</a>
<ul>
<li>BNN’s performance relies on a approximate posterior</li>
<li>Evaluating inference:
<ul>
<li>computes some distance metric between q(W) and p(W|D)</li>

<li>Fewer human priors as we move down the list above</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Can we explicitly <strong>learn priors from previous experience</strong>?</p></li>
<li><p>Brief Overview</p>
<ul>
<li>Given 1 example of 5 classes :
<ul>
<li>classify new examples</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How does meta-learning work?</p>
<ul>
<li>One approach : parameterize learner by a neural network</li>
<li>Another approach : embed optimization into the learning process</li>
<li>The Bayesian perspective : learn priors of a Bayesian model that we can use for posterior inference</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The problem</p>
<ul>
<li>How we construct tasks</li>
<li>What if label order is consistent?
<ul>
<li>A single functional can solve all the tasks</li>
<li>The network can simply learn to classify inputs, irrespective of the data distribution</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Meta-training to “close the box”</p>
<ul>
<li>If you tell the robot the task goal, the robot can <strong>ignore</strong> the trials</li>
<li>another example : pose estimation and object position
<ul>
<li>memorize the post and orientation of the meta-training set</li>
<li>at meta-test time, without knowing the canonical orientation, we don’t be able to accurate predict the orientation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What can we do about this?</p>
<ul>
<li>If we had a proper bayesiaan meta-learning algorithm that was learning a proper posterior, we might not have this problem</li>
<li>However, I’m not sure if we have the tools to create a proper meta-learning algorithm</li>
<li>If the tasks are mutually excluse, a single function cannot solve all the tasks (due to label shufflinf, etc.)</li>
<li>If tasks are <em>non-mutually exclusive</em>, a single function can solve all tasks
<ul>
<li>multiple solutions to the meta-learning problem</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Meta-regularization</p>
<ul>
<li>Control the information flow such that we can do zero-shot learning from the data
<ul>
<li>minimize the meta-training loss and the information contained within the parameters of the model</li>
<li>regularizing the weights forces the model to use information from the data as opposed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can combine this with a favorite meta-learning algorithm</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Does meta-regularization lead to better generalization?</p>

<ul>
<li>Challenge the assumption
<ul>
<li>ASsumptions that the approximate posterior that we use to model our BNN, ought to have correlations between the weights</li>
<li>Mean-field assumption that our weight distributions are independent of eachother because we’re avoiding intractability</li>
<li>This is less true as our neural network gets much deeper</li>

<li>Why might our approximate posterior need to have correlation between weights?
<ul>
<li>Maybe the true posterior does?</li>
<li>A lot of intuitions we have come from this small interpretable single layer 4 neuron model
<ul>
<li>What we think is that alot of these effects disappear as we get deeper and deeper networks</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>With depth, we can induce rich correlation over our output distribution with mean-field weights
<ul>
<li>one way to do this is to have covariance between <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{2}\)</span></li>

<li>Some uderlying true state of the world

<li>there is some lawful set there
<ul>
<li>can we invert this image, knowing what we know from optics, to derive information about the world</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The world changes over time and gives rise to a sequence of images that we see
<ul>
<li>these changes happen in lawful ways such as dynamics
<ul>
<li>We don’t want to treat these observations as IID</li>
<li>We can use this to constrain our inferences</li>
<li>Perception is constrained by dynamics</li>
</ul></li>
<li>People’s judgements about the slant of a ramp given the visual state of the ramp
<ul>
<li>as our perception of the ramp changes, if affects how we perceive the world</li>

<li>What are these dynamics in the world and how do we capture that?
<ul>
<li>Intuitive Physics ENgine

<li>The generative models we have in our heads are based on object baed representation
<ul>
<li>Some probability distribution presents a range of world state</li>
<li>This gives us a range of possible ways the world might unfold

<li>We run out model forward and count up the number of blocks</li>

<li>Important features

<li>object based

<li>probabilistic model
<ul>
<li>Not just one possible future, but range that we can make predictions over</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We don’t need a veridical model of physics but one good enough to action plan</li>
<li>This physics engine should favor speed and efficiency over precision</li>
<li>MOdel is generalizable in that we don’t need to learn separate physics models for all situations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do we do this?

<ul>
<li>Using brain imaging to study all kinds of cognitive processes in the brain
<ul>
<li>reflection bring frustration in that more information has been discovered such as where in the brain or when in the brain is the neural activity
<ul>
<li>less concentration on the “how” – this is a bit obvious as it’s easier to use these techniques to ask where and when</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once we understand the brain, what will be the form of the answer?
<ul>
<li>Design principles used wide in the brain
<ul>
<li>will vary in levels of detail – and we will surely have a description of how the brain computes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Whether we might be on the verge of a time when we can take a new approach to studying the question of “how” in the brain</li>
<li>Recent dramatic progress in the NN community where we’re gone from computers being blind, deaf, and dumb
<ul>
<li>We can now do many of these functions on machines</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are we at a point where we can now take advantage of these NN models for things like vision and language and use them as hypoethesis about how to brain does these same things.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Predicting fMRI output given people reading words
<ul>
<li>hand designed vector embedding by co-occurence with 25 verbs
<ul>
<li>predicting where in the brain we would find neural activity as a function of the input word stimulus</li>
</ul></li>
<li>this studies where in the brain</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gustatory cortex activity is associated with activity related to co-occurences of words with words like “eat”
<ul>
<li>suggestions that the semantics of words are often grounded in parts of the brains who’s functions are affiliated with those words</li>
<li>saying “peach” caused activation in certain parts of human brains</li>
<li>Our analysis is not asnwering the question “how”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can look at “when”
<ul>
<li>What information si encoded in space and time in the MEG video being shown</li>
<li>Is the encoding of the semantics a function of time or is it a discrete process?</li>
<li>Trained ~ 1,000,000 classifiers to predict activation in certain brain regions – the classifier was “decoding” the activity into words
<ul>
<li>most didn’t predict anything</li>
<li>some did
<ul>
<li>during the first 50 ms there was nothing to decode</li>
<li>next 50ms perceptual features could be decoded
<ul>
<li>we could get gross features of the line drawing as well</li>
</ul></li>
<li>200 ms, we have a semantic feature</li>
<li>250 ms, is it hollow?</li>
<li>400 ms even more</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>This is the kind of analysis that we can do on the <code>When and Where</code> details</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At 50ms time intervals how accurately can we decode words from activity patterns captured through fMRI
<ul>
<li>decodability of feature “wordlength” (peak decodability 100-150ms)</li>
<li>this information doesn’t first appear “here” and then move
<ul>
<li>it can be decoded simultaneously</li>
<li>there’s a synchrony that occurs between these disparate parts of the brain at the same time
<ul>
<li>This allows us to look at when</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Maybe these 6 regions work together to figure this out?
<ul>
<li>maybe not; maybe something else</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>How does the brain compute nueral representations?
<ul>
<li>Paradigm for studying “how”
<ul>
<li>stimulus input to both models and the brain - compare the learned mappings - and measure the output of both systems</li>
<li>our program is an example of “how”
<ul>
<li>if we have 10 models, we can ask other questions like “does it allow us to explain, predict, the observed neural activity than the previous model?”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>AN example of what this paradigm implies
<ul>
<li>each point on the slide is a hypothesis, the model obvs being the hypothesis
<ul>
<li>the more accurate the model is at recognizing the objects in this image
<ul>
<li>the better it is at predicting the neural activity in humans</li>
<li>correlation between the two models’ performance</li>
</ul></li>

<li>CNN v4 alignment
<ul>
<li>penultimate layer – both predict more accurately than the output layer</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>How? : Language Processing
<ul>
<li>Same concept as the CNN example above, this work was done using computation language models
<ul>
<li>BERT</li>
<li>ELMo</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MEG scanner and showed the patients a new word every 500ms
<ul>
<li>Sentence mean MEG activity</li>
<li>184 different sentences in passive and active voice</li>
<li>Used the above language models above and for every sentence they constructed each prefix of the sentence and fed it into the model
<ul>
<li>linear regression used to predict the neural activity</li>
<li>predicted the 500ms neural activity</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Which of these models works best/
<ul>
<li>brain actibity prediction accuracy*
<ul>
<li><a href="">Paper</a>?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>if we consider these models as hypothesis we can now rank them</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Will this paradigm really work? referencing the alignment approach
<ul>
<li>these studies have empirical evidence</li>
<li>Is this helpful?</li>
<li>Limits:
<ul>
<li>mismatch between sequential computer processing vs.&nbsp;oscillatory, parallel neural activity</li>
<li>there’s a mismatch of constant activity in deep nets vs spiking in the brain</li>
<li>mismatch in what we’re even measuring using these experiments
<ul>
<li>bloog oxygen, fluctuations, etc. and actual neural activity</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Important questions:
<ol type="1">
<li>Does observed neural activity represent neural data representations, or <em>processes that alter</em> neural representations? (e.g.&nbsp;predictive coding : activity reflects energy being expended to update representations)
<ul>
<li>word by word neural activity while reading - reading word number 4 doesn’t mean we can decode the first word
<ul>
<li>we can’t find it in the neural activity - we could when it appeared on the screen
<ul>
<li>is this measuring a delta or the representation of the stimulus?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>What are brains truly doing/</li>
<li>How does context influence?</li>
<li>Should we care if we model only part of it? (BERT doesn’t model word <em>perception</em>)</li>
<li>If we can’t interpret representations in deep nets, does it help explain brain activity in terms of these?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Alisnging activity bween DNNs and neural activity
<ul>
<li>we can write down computation hypothesis and try to align these</li>

<li>Contrasting with the Symbolic AI Program</li>
<li>Choices that are happening within the mind aren’t an active process
<ul>
<li>This system 1 computation in that it is intuitive and performs a selection of things that are relative to the situation</li>
<li>This is a reason why we need to put together the disiderata of the two fields of Symbolic and DNN approaches</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Building block for conscious processing is attention
<ul>
<li>focus on one or a few elements at a time</li>
<li>content based soft-attention is concenient, can brkprop to learn where to atend</li>
<li>attention is an internal action</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Attention is also a key to something also very important
<ul>
<li>memory</li>
<li>credit assignment</li>
<li>vanishing gradients come up in training NN’s</li>
<li>unreasonable to assume brains are doing anything like BBTT</li>
<li>Alternative to this introduces at the last NeurIPS

<li>eliminating the exponential loss of gradients problem</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Attention really forces NN’s to develop a form of representation for indirect references
<ul>
<li>why is this coming up?</li>
<li>attention mechanisms
<ul>
<li>there are many inputs “fighting” for attention and the module that receives the weighted sum and it sin’t able to understand which modules contributed to the weights</li>
</ul></li>
<li>this allows us to think of NN”s as set transformation machines</li>

<li>Long term goal is to have ane nvironment where learning agents are faced with gradually more difficult tasks
<ul>
<li>where humans are in the loop, helping the agents to figure out how it works and communicate with humans</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Affordances, options, exploration &amp; controllable factors
<ul>
<li>affordances : concepts / aspects of the environment which can be changed by the agent</li>
<li>temporal abstractions : options, super-actions, macros, or prcedures, which can be more complext procedures</li>
<li>controllable factors
<ul>
<li>jointly learn a set of (policy, factor) such that the policy can control the factor and maximize the mutual information between policues (Bengio et al 2017) <a href="">Paper</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consciousness Prior :
<ul>
<li>high level variables have a joint distribution, and are not independent which we can manipulate with language</li>
<li>graph that represents the joint is a sparse factor graph
<ul>
<li>each of the factors in a factor graph corrrespond to a dependency between a group of variables</li>
<li>it’s making a statement that links these 3 variables
<ul>
<li>each statement as one possible sentence in natural language.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>What’s the connection?
<ul>
<li>inference in a graphical model such as this allows us to exploit the sparsity of the graph and we sould visit the the nodes in this graph and it would require we only look at a few neighbors
<ul>
<li>selecting these variables from a large set, at lteast the in</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The brain is performing inference on this factor graph</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What <strong>causes</strong> changes in distributions
<ul>
<li>the changes in these distributions are about agents doing things and causing these shifts in the world</li>
<li>actions are localized in space and time
<ul>
<li>these changes could be explained by just a few variables in the right model
<ul>
<li>videos – pixels at timesteps, we’re dead in the water</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>consequences of an intervention on few causes or mechanisms</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How to factorize a joint distribution means uncovering this cause and effect structure
<ul>
<li>Bengio et al arxiv : 1901.10912</li>
<li>We can recover from a change in distribution faster</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Disentangling the causes:
<ul>
<li>A meta-transwer objective for learning to disentangle causal mechanisms</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Doing inference on the Intervention
<ul>
<li>Learning causal models from unknown interventions
<ul>
<li>learning small causal graphs, avoid exponential explosions of # of fraphs by parameterizing factorized distributions over graphs</li>

<p><a href="">Slides</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The human language network
<ul>
<li>This workshop, but more generally, what people call language seems way beyond what language actually is</li>
</ul></li>
<li>stable structure that spans across people and all brains</li>
<li>A stronger response to sentences than lists of unconnected words</li>
<li>Why is the sentence the preferred stimulus
<ul>
<li>structure</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What features of linguistic simuli and what associated computations drive neural responses in the human language system?</li>
<li>Abstract structure
<ul>
<li>domain general syntactic processnig</li>
<li>some argue about key hierarchical structure</li>
<li>share that all computations behind language processing are highly abstract</li>
<li>Overlapping structures in numberical cognition and language and music and language</li>
<li>data suggest that this region of our brain is used as much when solving math as when looking at a blank screen
<ul>
<li>effectively not at all</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Spacial and mentalization</li>
<li>All of these aspects don’t engage regions that handle language for us</li>
<li>When processing computer langauges – we had people read snippets of code the critical condition is code comprehension
<ul>
<li>understanding coding problems DID NOT elicit a response in the language network</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rules out this abstract syntactical structural processor</li>
<li>Puts a damper on modeling language in a really abstract way</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Meaningful event / event comprehension
<ul>
<li>can this representation and activation be linked to sound or story, etc.</li>
<li>presented participants with sentences and pictures of certain events and asked them to perform hard tasks</li>
<li>semantic conditions elicit a non-trivial amount of repsonse but still lower than the sentence condition</li>
<li>Language regions may engage in processing non-verbal representations
<ul>
<li>evidence of people with brain damage that language cortex isn’t required for abstract concept mangement, or some such</li>
<li>what features are necessary and sufficient to elicit neural responses in face-selective cells / brain areas?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Motivation - vision research</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Syntactic frame
<ul>
<li>language specific meaning-independent syntactic processing</li>
<li>what is a syntactic frame?: word order, function words, functional morphology</li>
<li>sentences elicit the strongest response, word list is 2 or more times lower</li>
<li>jabberwonky is even lower</li>
<li>a syntactic frame on it’s own elicits a low response in the language specific cortex</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Syntactic frame + meaning
<ul>
<li>Grammatrical word order / word-order-based, prediction</li>
<li>combinatorially (semantic + syntactic) of words / composition</li>
<li>Reasons to facor composition as the core driver :
<ul>
<li>combinability of words in the nearby context seems to be a true universal property of our lingual systems
<ol type="1">
<li>compositional</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Destroying word order while preserving local combinability
<ul>
<li>colors for no reason than to show manipulations</li>
<li>made local word swaps</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Estimating local combinabiliy:
<ul>
<li>using PMI - does a reasonable job of measuring how dependent two words are on eachother</li>
<li>this measures a little bit more bias toward semantics because it weights down certain words</li>
<li>fMRI Results
<ul>
<li>one of many examples where I wasn’t predicting the results and the results blew my mind</li>
<li>the response doesn’t drop <em>AT ALL</em> with the swapping of the words</li>
</ul></li>
<li>has been reproduced multiple times</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Locality
<ul>
<li>Is it important?</li>
<li>Prior reasons to suspect that it is:
<ol type="1">
<li>the language network doesn’t care about structure above clause/sentence level;</li>
<li>most dependencies in natural language are local (Futrell et al 2015)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Destroying word order and minimizing (local) combinabiity
<ul>
<li>shuffling this causes a drop in the results that coincides with random word order list</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“Local coherence, global gibberish”
<ul>
<li>human language system is all about local sentence coherence</li>
<li>span where humans can track is ~ 6 to 7 words</li>
<li>6 words is the beginning of how much activation correlates given any length of input, it seems like it’s the lower bound</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Take home message
<ul>
<li>Linguistic composition is the overall driver of the language system</li>
<li></li>
</ul></li>
