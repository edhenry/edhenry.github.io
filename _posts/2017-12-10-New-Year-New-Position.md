Anyone that was tracking the data networking industry's movements over the last year, knows there was an announcement that Broadcom would be acquiring Brocade. This finally happened within the last 30 days, and then a subsequent acquisition of Ruckus by Arris has finalized the deal completely. With these announcements, I to have my own.

For the last two years, I'd worked on all things data for the company's product portfolio, along with the research and application of data science and machine learning to our product portfolios along with ongoing efforts within organizations like the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), the research arm of the larger IETF. There were many projects that I've worked on and many ideas that I was able to test and apply to interesting problems in the infrastructure space but mostly I loved the people that I was working with and the constant challenge that was there to improve both my hard and soft skills in applying, and educating on the theory and application(s), of machine learning in the data networking and larger technology infrastructure space. 

As with most things in life though, seemingly especially good things, they come to an end. 

I wanted to reflect on what I've learned throughout my tenure at Brocade, in an attempt to sum up my takeaways. Here goes.

* I learned what impostor syndrome, and Dunning-Kruger, looked like and felt like. Lots of highs and lows.

* I learned what teamwork looks and feels like in, what at the time, was one of the largest companies I'd ever worked for.

* I learned what real talent looks like, and it certainly wasn't me, or at least it didn't feel like it.

* I learned what developing strategy, architecture, and following through with engineering those thoughts, really felt like.

* I learned what impact a group of people who really believe in something can have on the larger picture of a company.

With that understanding, I am making the choice to leave my position within what is now Ruckus, an Arris Company. I've accepted a position within the Dell EMC Service Provider Solutions and Strategy group, under [Kevin Shatzkamer](https://twitter.com/kshatzka), to work on what I've been working on the last 2+ years. The application of data science and machine learning in the service provider, and larger technology infrastructure, space. And I can't be more excited!

Thank you to everyone within Brocade who believed in me when I didn't believe in myself.

Here's to 2018 and on!
