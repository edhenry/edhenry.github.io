@ARTICLE{Legg2006-nl,
  title         = "A Formal Measure of Machine Intelligence",
  author        = "Legg, Shane and Hutter, Marcus",
  abstract      = "A fundamental problem in artificial intelligence is that
                   nobody really knows what intelligence is. The problem is
                   especially acute when we need to consider artificial systems
                   which are significantly different to humans. In this paper
                   we approach this problem in the following way: We take a
                   number of well known informal definitions of human
                   intelligence that have been given by experts, and extract
                   their essential features. These are then mathematically
                   formalised to produce a general measure of intelligence for
                   arbitrary machines. We believe that this measure formally
                   captures the concept of machine intelligence in the broadest
                   reasonable sense.",
